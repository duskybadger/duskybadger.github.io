This project studies the many different smartphone apps that are in the market. The mobile phone gaming market is an enormous industry starting with the Pokemon interactive project in 2018. I wanted to learn and rank the games with the greatest value to the consumer. This entails analyzing two different price points, sales price and cost price, of each app. This was done by combining several different sources of raw data: a CSV file, a table scraped from a website, and an API. Then, by combining this raw data using Python, I was able to regularize the data into one large file and then save it in a database.
