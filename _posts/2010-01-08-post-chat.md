In this first project I will be using an API to gather all of my data. The website is called fantasymath.com and is cited above. What I would like to do with this data is code three different subprojects. The first project is the automatic import. This function is one which automatically brings in all data from the API and places it in a database using MySql. Part of this function will be generating a personal token for the website and then validating the token with a printed message. This will be done to provide a visual cue to anyone who uses the code that the function was successful in generating a token and accessing the website. A simple f-string will be used to show the token authentication was successful.
