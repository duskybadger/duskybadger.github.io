This project attempts to build a model to empower marketing to learn more about different customer behaviors. This project takes and uses a large dataset, as big a dataset as that found at Expedia, and builds a model to group this data, aka customers, by their activity. The activity could be applied to anything: purchases, clicks, phone calls, etc.
